# News Feeds

A homework assignment [here](http://www.se.rit.edu/~swen-344/homeworks/IndividualFeed.html)

users login to see a selection of rss feeds and have the ability to favorite a post. These favorites are saved locally, either in a json file or localStorage along with user info. The user also is notified of when they last logged in.
